This project is a java swing version of the minesweeper game. When clicked, blocks indicate how many bombs it is touching. If the player happens to click on a box that is a bomb, the game is over. The player can right click once on a block to flag it, indicating they know it is a bomb, or right click twice to question mark it, indicating it may be a bomb. The player wins when they correctly identify all the bombs. The game is in testing mode so that it is easier to run and test.
